# russian-language-nlp
Repo with collections of 2 types: 1st links to language models, corpuses &amp; tools to process Russian language &amp; 2nd collection of different course/articles &amp; tutorials about NLP &amp; written on RU


In this repo I try to consolidate all information about articles, packages and researches that relative to NLP on Russian language. 
Because a lot of pages that a refer to  contains only RU docs or writed on RU language - I will mark lang in [brackets] near the source. 

If you want to add something in list - just open the PR.
